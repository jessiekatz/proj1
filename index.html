                        Kai Chen has seen the growth of boba tea in the United States ever since it came to California in the 90s.
                        Boba has been "nearly fully integrated into American culture." He sees advertisements for boba milkshakes in fast food chains and boba ice cream in Costco. 
                        While this has happened, he believes boba's value has been <span class="quotePlain">"cheapened."</span>
